# Avalanche C-Chain Liquidity Sniper ❄️🔥

Catches the exact second someone adds real liquidity (>5 AVAX) to a new pool on Avalanche — TraderJoe, Pangolin, whatever.

This is the real "ding ding" moment before the chart even appears on DexScreener.

### What you get
- Instant liquidity add detection  
- Token contract before anyone else sees it  
- Direct links to tx + DexScreener  
- Sub-3-second edge on the ice  

```bash
python avalanche_c_chain_sniper.py
